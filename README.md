# Journal-Publishing
This project is a web-based journal publishing platform built with Laravel. It facilitates the submission, review, and publication of academic journals, supporting multiple user roles with distinct functionalities:

    Author: Authors can submit their manuscripts, track submission status, and communicate with reviewers and editors.
    Admin: Admins manage the overall platform, including user accounts, roles, and journal settings.
    Editorial: The editorial team oversees the review process, assigns reviewers, and makes final decisions on manuscript publications.
    Reviewer: Reviewers provide critical feedback on submitted manuscripts and recommend decisions to the editorial team.
    User: General users can browse published journals, search for articles, and register to become an author or reviewer.

This platform aims to streamline the journal publishing process, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow from submission to publication.
